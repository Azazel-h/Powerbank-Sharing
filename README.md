- ##### It was probably my first industrial development experience. A great entry point..
> Created in 2018-2019 by students of yndx/301 MSHP.

> - Probably I will work on it a bit more, but not sure.
> - In any case, it was a great experience and motivation. An idea, which we invented in 2018 is now used at least all over Moscow.
